# Shortcut audit against FL Studio's manual

Checked on 2026-10-16 against the manual's "Keyboard and mouse shortcuts" page
(image-line.com, FL Studio online manual, `basics_shortcuts.htm`), read through a text extraction of the page:
a line that the extraction dropped would not show here. Every line of that list is below with what PULP does.

**On macOS** read Ctrl as Command and Alt as Option throughout (FL Studio's Mac edition does the same).
Two standard keys differ there because macOS owns them: Pause is Control+Space (Command+Space opens
Spotlight) and Stop all sound is Command+period (Command+H hides the program). Delete also answers to the
Mac's delete (backspace) key.

- **same**: the key does the same thing in PULP.
- **added**: the same, and it was added during this audit (milestone 14).
- **no**: PULP has the feature but not on a key, or has no such feature; the note says which.

The program-wide keys (the sections File, Pattern selector, Transport, Window navigation and Global) can be
changed in Settings > SHORTCUTS. The keys that belong to one window are fixed.
